# NYC Trip Duration Predictive Modeling 

## Overview

The NYC Trip Duration Predictive Model is a system designed to estimate how long taxi trips in New York City will take. This model takes into account various factors like weather, traffic, time of day, and locations to make accurate predictions. By analyzing historical data, the model learns patterns and trends, allowing it to provide reliable estimates for the duration of future taxi rides. The goal is to help both taxi drivers and passengers plan their journeys more effectively, considering the dynamic and complex nature of urban transportation in New York City.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:

- Load the NYC taxi trip duration dataset.
- Handle missing values and clean the data.
- Convert data types if necessary.

### 2. Data Exploration:

- Explore the basic statistics of numerical features.
- Visualize the distribution of trip durations.
- Investigate the distribution of categorical features.

### 3. Temporal Analysis:

- Explore how trip duration varies over time (day of the week, hour of the day, month).
- Identify patterns or trends in taxi usage.

### 4. Spatial Analysis:

- Visualize the distribution of pickups and drop-offs on a map.
- Analyze trip duration based on geographic factors.

### 5. Feature Engineering:

- Create new features that might be useful for modeling.
- Investigate the correlation between features and trip duration.

### 6. Outlier Detection:

- Identify and handle outliers in the dataset.
- Analyze the impact of outliers on the analysis.

### 7. Correlation Analysis:

- Explore correlations between variables.
- Identify potential relationships that may impact trip duration.

### 8. Visualization:

- Create informative visualizations to convey key insights.
- Utilize various plots (scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps) for effective communication.

### 9. Model Building:

- Implement machine learning algorithms for predicting taxi trip durations.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Fine-tune and optimize the chosen model for better performance.

### 10. Conclusions and Future Steps:

- Summarize key findings from the analysis.
